### 🔭 Upcoming Projects

My next project will be focused on cleaning and analysing a dataset in Python. Ι am using/ learning some more complex visualisation methods on Tableau to express some groundbreaking insights truly. I have mastered SQL and am curious and eager to explore and discover the Pandas library properly with this project. I believe the exploration of this dataset would do the trick!
